# Psyhealth AI Chatbot Project

Welcome to the Psyhealth AI Chatbot project. This project focuses on developing a generative AI chatbot to support mental health by integrating it into the Psyhealth website.

## Project Overview
The Psyhealth AI Chatbot project leverages IBM Cloud services, specifically Watson Assistant and Watson X, to provide two main functionalities:

### Talk with Dr. AI
This feature allows users to engage with the chatbot to obtain information related to mental health. Users can ask questions, seek advice, and receive information on various aspects of mental health. The chatbot is designed to provide accurate and helpful responses to user queries.

### Book a Consultation
The "Book a Consultation" feature enables users to schedule appointments or consultations with professional psychologists through interactions with the chatbot. This functionality streamlines the process of arranging appointments, making it convenient for users to seek professional help when needed.

## Project Components
- The website for Psyhealth, built using HTML and CSS, serves as the front-end landing page for users to access the chatbot.
- The chatbot's core functionality is powered by IBM Cloud services, specifically Watson Assistant and Watson X.
